        Creates a player if one doesn't exist with the given information.

        If node is provided, a player will be created on that node.
        If region is provided, a player will be created on a node in the given region.
        If endpoint is provided, Lavalink.py will attempt to parse the region from the endpoint
        and return a node in the parsed region.

        If node, region and endpoint are left unspecified, or region/endpoint selection fails,
        Lavalink.py will fall back to the node with the lowest penalty.

        Region can be omitted if node is specified and vice-versa.

        Parameters
        ----------
        guild_id: :class:`int`
            The guild_id to associate with the player.
        region: Optional[:class:`str`]
            The region to use when selecting a Lavalink node.
            Defaults to ``None``.
        endpoint: Optional[:class:`str`]
            The address of the Discord voice server.
            Defaults to ``None``.
        node: Optional[:class:`Node`]
            The node to put the player on.
            Defaults to ``None``, which selects the node with the lowest penalty.
        node_filter: Optional[Callable[[:class:`Node`], :class:`bool`]]
            A filter to use when selecting nodes this player can be assigned to.
            This cannot be used with the ``node`` parameter.
            Nodes are filtered based on the given predicate, and then again based on their penalty score.
            If no nodes are found after filtering, all available nodes will be considered without filtering.
        cls: Optional[Type[:class:`BasePlayer`]]
            The player class to use when instantiating a new player.
            Defaults to ``None`` which uses the player class provided to :class:`Client`.
            If no class was provided, this will typically be :class:`DefaultPlayer`.

            Warning
            -------
            This function could return a player of a different type to that specified in ``cls``,
            if a player was created before with a different class type.

        Raises
        ------
        :class:`ValueError`
            If the provided ``cls`` is not a valid subclass of :class:`BasePlayer`.

        Returns
        -------
        :class:`BasePlayer`
            A class that inherits ``BasePlayer``. By default, the actual class returned will
            be :class:`DefaultPlayer`, however if you have specified a custom player implementation,
            then this will be different.
