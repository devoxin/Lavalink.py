    """
    Represents the stats of Lavalink node.

    Attributes
    ----------
    uptime: :class:`int`
        How long the node has been running for in milliseconds.
    players: :class:`int`
        The amount of players connected to the node.
    playing_players: :class:`int`
        The amount of players that are playing in the node.
    memory_free: :class:`int`
        The amount of memory free to the node.
    memory_used: :class:`int`
        The amount of memory that is used by the node.
    memory_allocated: :class:`int`
        The amount of memory allocated to the node.
    memory_reservable: :class:`int`
        The amount of memory reservable to the node.
    cpu_cores: :class:`int`
        The amount of cpu cores the system of the node has.
    system_load: :class:`int`
        The overall CPU load of the system.
    lavalink_load: :class:`int`
        The CPU load generated by Lavalink.
    frames_sent: :class:`int`
        The number of frames sent to Discord.

        Warning
        -------
        Given that audio packets are sent via UDP, this number may not be 100% accurate due to dropped packets.
    frames_nulled: :class:`int`
        The number of frames that yielded null, rather than actual data.
    frames_deficit: :class:`int`
        The number of missing frames. Lavalink generates this figure by calculating how many packets to expect
        per minute, and deducting ``frames_sent``. Deficit frames could mean the CPU is overloaded, and isn't
        generating frames as quickly as it should be.
