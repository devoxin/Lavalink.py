class Client:
    """
    Represents a Lavalink client used to manage nodes and connections.

    Parameters
    ----------
    user_id: Union[:class:`int`, :class:`str`]
        The user id of the bot.
    player: Type[:class:`BasePlayer`]
        The class that should be used for the player. Defaults to :class:`DefaultPlayer`.
        Do not change this unless you know what you are doing!
    regions: Optional[Dict[str, Tuple[str]]]
        A mapping of continent -> Discord RTC regions.
        The key should be an identifier used when instantiating an node.
        The values should be a list of RTC regions that will be handled by the associated identifying key.

        Example: ``{"us": ("us-central", "us-east", "us-south", "us-west", "brazil")}``

        You should only change this if you know what you're doing and want more control over
        region groups. Defaults to ``None``.
    connect_back: Optional[:class:`bool`]
        A boolean that determines if a player will connect back to the
        node it was originally connected to. This is not recommended to do since
        the player will most likely be performing better in the new node. Defaults to ``False``.

        Warning
        -------
        If this option is enabled and the player's node is changed through `Player.change_node` after
        the player was moved via the failover mechanism, the player will still move back to the original
        node when it becomes available. This behaviour can be avoided in custom player implementations by
        setting ``self._original_node`` to ``None`` in the :func:`BasePlayer.change_node` function.

    Attributes
    ----------
    node_manager: :class:`NodeManager`
        The node manager, used for storing and managing all registered Lavalink nodes.
    player_manager: :class:`PlayerManager`
        The player manager, used for storing and managing all players.
    sources: Set[:class:`Source`]
