    Attributes
    ----------
    LOOP_NONE: :class:`int`
        Class attribute. Disables looping entirely.
    LOOP_SINGLE: :class:`int`
        Class attribute. Enables looping for a single (usually currently playing) track only.
    LOOP_QUEUE: :class:`int`
        Class attribute. Enables looping for the entire queue. When a track finishes playing, it'll be added to the end of the queue.

    guild_id: :class:`int`
        The guild id of the player.
    node: :class:`Node`
        The node that the player is connected to.
    paused: :class:`bool`
        Whether or not a player is paused.
    position_timestamp: :class:`int`
        Returns the track's elapsed playback time as an epoch timestamp.
    volume: :class:`int`
        The volume at which the player is playing at.
    shuffle: :class:`bool`
        Whether or not to mix the queue up in a random playing order.
    loop: Literal[0, 1, 2]
        Whether loop is enabled, and the type of looping.
        This is an integer as loop supports multiple states.

        0 = Loop off.

        Warning
        -------
        Multiple calls to this method short timeframe could cause issues with the player's internal state,

        Parameters
        ----------
        track: Optional[Union[:class:`DeferredAudioTrack`, :class:`AudioTrack`, Dict[str, Union[Optional[str], bool, int]]]]
            The track to play. If left unspecified, this will default to the first track in the queue. Defaults to ``None``

        start_time: :class:`int`
            The number of milliseconds to offset the track by.
            If left unspecified, the track will start from the beginning.
        end_time: :class:`int`
            The position at which the track should stop playing.
            This is an absolute position, so if you want the track to stop at 1 minute, you would pass 60000.
            If left unspecified, the track will play through to the end.
        no_replace: :class:`bool`
            If set to true, operation will be ignored if the player already has a current track.
            If left unspecified, the currently playing track will always be replaced.
        volume: :class:`int`
            The initial volume to set. This is useful for changing the volume between tracks etc.
            If left unspecified, the volume will remain at its current setting.
        pause: :class:`bool`
            Whether to immediately pause the track after loading it. Defaults to ``False``.
        **kwargs: Any
            The kwargs to use when playing. You can specify any extra parameters that may be
            used by plugins, which offer extra features not supported out-of-the-box by Lavalink.py.
